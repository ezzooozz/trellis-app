# Form questions

Before you can add a question, you have to add at least one section and page. This is done by clicking the "Add 
section" and "Add page" buttons in the form builder.

Once you've created a containing page, you can add a question: 
1. Click the "Add question" button
1. Add the question text--if you have multiple languages, this will be assigned to the default language for your study.
1. Add a unique question variable name--this is used to identify the data collected by this question in the reports.
1. Add the question type--several different types of questions are supported (see [question types](Question-types.md) 
for more details).
1. Click "Create".

To delete a question section, click the "x" button to the right of the question's variable name. 

To reorder questions within a page, click the arrows icon in the upper-left corner and drag the question to the desired 
location. It may be easier to reorder questions after minimizing them by clicking the "-" icon in the upper-right
corner.

## Question parameters

Question parameters control many options; including, minimum and maximum input values, whether an answer is required in
order for the surveyor to advance to the next page, and other special question features. To add a question parameter, 
click the "Add Parameter" button, select the parameter type using the drop-down and enter the parameter value in the 
provided text input. For more information about the available question parameters, see [question parameters](Question-parameters.md).

## Condition assignment

Conditions are text identifiers (e.g. is_female, has_children, watches_tv) you can apply to a respondent or form based
on responses to questions. Applied conditions may be used to show or hide questions, show or hide forms, and filter 
respondent search results (respondent scope condition tags only). 

To add a condition based on a response to a question, click the "Assign Condition" button. For more information, see 
[conditions](Conditions.md).
