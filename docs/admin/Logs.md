# Logs
The logs module is only visible on the mobile app. Each device keeps separate logs with any errors and useful 
debugging information.

To view all of the information contained in a single log row, click on the row to expand it.

To upload the logs from this tablet to the server click the hamburger menu in the top right corner and then click 
"Upload logs" button to begin the upload.

To delete logs from the local database, click the "Delete logs" button. It is recommended that you upload logs 
before deleting them locally.
