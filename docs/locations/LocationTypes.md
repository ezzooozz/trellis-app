# Location Types
Each location in Trellis has a "type". The "Location types" module is used to add, remove and edit these location types. Each location type has the following properties:

- Respondents can create
  - This property indicates whether or not new locations of this type can be created by respondents in the context of a survey.
- Respondents can add children
  - When this property is enabled, respondents will be able to add child locations in the context of a survey. For example, adding new buildings in a City.
- Can contain respondents
  - This property indicates whether or not a respondent can be associated with this location. For example, you might want respondents to be associated with a Building within a City, but not associated with the City directly.


Some examples of common location types reflect the logical way that we divide geographic spaces. For example, some types of locations might be "Country", "State", and "City" with several locations with each type.
