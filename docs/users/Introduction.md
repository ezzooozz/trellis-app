# Users
The users view allows users with the correct permissions to add, remove and modify users in the system. In Trellis, a user is someone who has the ability to directly interact with the data stored in Trellis. Depending on a user's role, they may be able to add and modify forms, studies, languages, locations, etc in addition to being able to conduct surveys on behalf of respondents.

Trellis is a distributed, offline system which means that a full [sync](../Glossary#sync), will be required for any changes to users to get sent to a mobile device.

## Adding users
To add a user click the **plus** icon in the top right corner of the page. This will open a dialog that has the required fields for a new user. Once all of the fields are filled out, click **save** to create the user.

#### Name
The real name of the user.
#### Username
The unique name used to login to Trellis.
#### Role
The role of the user controls what they have access to. These roles can be modified and changed. See [permissions](../admin/Permissions.md) for more information.
#### Password
The initial password for that surveyor. All users can change their password to whatever they would like.

## Editing users
To edit a user, click the **edit** icon near that user. The dialog will look nearly identical to the create user dialog, but the password field will be gone. Make any edits to the user and click **save** to finish the edits.

## Removing users
To remove a user, click the **delete** icon for that user. You will be required to confirm the deletion before it will occur.
